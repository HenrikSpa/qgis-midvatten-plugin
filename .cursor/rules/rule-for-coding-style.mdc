# When to trigger

- When creating or modifying python code

# Code style

- The coding style should follow PEP8 using the ruff linter.

    For example:
    * Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
    * Function names, method names, variable names, and function arguments should be snake_case.
    * Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.
    * Add python type hints (often using the python library typing) to the arguments of functions and methods.

- After any Python code modifications, automatically run the following commands to ensure code quality:
    1. Run linting and fixes: `ruff check --fix .`
    2. Run formatting: `ruff format .`
    3. If any errors persist, fix them automatically.

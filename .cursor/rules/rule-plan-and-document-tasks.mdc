# When To Trigger

- If a task has the potential to be very long, and the context might be used up.

# Create plan files and task log files

- Make a plan file of what has been done and what remains to be done so that a new agent can continue the remaining tasks.
- If the context is close to being used up, write the plan file, paus the work and tell the user that it's recommended that a new agent continue with the remaining tasks described in the file.

# Self-Corrected Rule Hygiene

## Purpose
Maintain clarity, prevent redundancy, and ensure long-term scalability
of self-generated rules.

---

# WHEN TO RUN

Run hygiene check when:

- Total self-corrected rules > 10
OR
- A new rule overlaps with existing rule
OR
- A rule is triggered frequently

---

# HYGIENE CHECKLIST

For each rule:

1. Is it still relevant?
2. Is it redundant?
3. Can it merge with another?
4. Is it too specific?
5. Is it contradicted elsewhere?

---

# MERGE POLICY

If two rules share ≥ 70% prevention scope:
  - Merge them
  - Keep broader formulation
  - Archive the narrower rule

---

# CONFLICT POLICY

If self_corrected rule conflicts with:
  - core-rules
  - user-defined rules outside folder

Then:
  - Do NOT auto-edit
  - Produce suggestion
  - Request approval

---

# RULE LIMIT

Hard cap: 30 self-corrected rules.

If limit exceeded:
  - Must merge or delete before adding new rule.

---

# QUALITY STANDARD

Each rule must:
- Be generalizable
- Prevent class of bugs
- Be architecture-aware
- Contain clear trigger conditions
- Include example violation

Otherwise reject.

---

# IMPACT PRIORITIZATION

During hygiene:

1. Sort rules by Impact Score.
2. Review low-impact rules first for:
   - Merge
   - Deactivation
   - Removal suggestion

High-impact rules require more conservative changes.

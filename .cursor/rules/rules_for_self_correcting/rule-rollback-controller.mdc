# Self-Corrected Rule Rollback Controller

## Purpose
Provide a controlled mechanism to deactivate or revert unsafe, harmful,
or low-value self-corrected rules.

---

# WHEN TO TRIGGER ROLLBACK REVIEW

Trigger review if:

1. A self-corrected rule causes:
   - Repeated false positives
   - Over-restriction
   - Blocked valid solutions
   - Conflict loops
   - Reduced solution quality

OR

2. The rule is implicated in ≥ 2 regressions.

OR

3. User explicitly flags rule as problematic.

# ROLLBACK ANALYSIS (MANDATORY)

### ROLLBACK EVALUATION

- Rule Name:
- Original Intent:
- Observed Negative Effect:
- Type of Failure:
  - [ ] Overfitting
  - [ ] Overgeneralization
  - [ ] Conflicts with core rules
  - [ ] Excessive restriction
  - [ ] Redundant after merge
- Is harm structural or contextual?
- Impact Score at creation:
- Current Observed Stability Impact:
  - Positive
  - Neutral
  - Negative

# ROLLBACK DECISION OPTIONS

Based on analysis:

1. SOFT ROLLBACK
   - Mark rule as "Inactive"
   - Retain file with status header
   - Do not delete

2. HARD ROLLBACK (Requires Approval)
   - Remove rule file
   - Log removal in rule-impact-ledger.mdc

3. REFACTOR
   - Modify rule to narrower scope
   - Recompute Impact Score

---

# STRICT SAFETY POLICY

- Never delete a rule automatically.
- Never modify rules outside:
  .cursor/rules/self_corrected_rules
- If rollback affects interaction with external rules:
  Provide suggestion only.

---

# STATUS HEADER FORMAT

Every rule must contain:

Status: Active / Inactive / Refactored

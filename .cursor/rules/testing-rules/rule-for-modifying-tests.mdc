## When To Trigger

- When modifying tests

## Rules when modifying tests:

- Read .cursor/rules/rule-for-creating-tests.mdc for information about how test should be written.
- NEVER change the test reference data (the data that tests are compared against) unless explicitly told to do so.
- ALWAYS find the true cause why tests fail. Do not change tests just to make then pass while leaving true bugs in the code.
